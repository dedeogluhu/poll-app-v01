# Poll App v01

- I wanted to experience various backend and frontend technologies so i started with this project. 

- My goal is to make the similar projects with all of them and see the differences.

- Started this one with express using pug and sass engines and going to add a MongoDb.
   
   Current thoughts: 
    - Pug makes it easier to write but i find it harder to read.  
    - Sass feels like i am overengineering the project. 
    
- **I am going to update the readme.**
