# Poll App v01

- I wanted to compare and experience various backend and frontend technologies. 

- Going to make the same project with all of them but i can change my mind depending on the situation.

- Started this one with express using pug and sass engines and going to add a MongoDb.
   
   Current thoughts: 
    - Pug makes it easier to write but i find it harder to read.  
    - Sass feels like i am overengineering the project. 
    
- **I am going to update the readme.**
