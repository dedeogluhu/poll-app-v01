# Archived this version of the project because: <br> - Pug is not readable <br> - Sass is an overkill for this project <br> - I made a bad design choice <br> - I don't want to waste my time on it 

## Introduction

- I wanted to experience various backend and frontend technologies so i started with this project. 

- My goal is to make the similar projects with all of them and see the differences.

- Started this one with express using pug and sass engines and going to add a MongoDB database.
   
   Current thoughts: 
    - Pug makes it easier to write but i find it harder to read.  
    - Sass feels like i am overengineering the project.
