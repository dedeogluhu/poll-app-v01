# poll-app-v01

- I wanted to compare and experience various backend and frontend technologies. I am going to make poll apps with some of them and starting with this.

- I am going to add a proper readme with the technologies when the time comes.

- Currently started with express using pug and sass engines. Pug makes it easier to write but i find it harder to read and sass feels like i am overengineering the project.
